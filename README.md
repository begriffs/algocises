[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/begriffs/algorithm-freezer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/begriffs/algorithm-freezer)
Fill in the blanks and submit implementations for basic algorithms
in javascript.  Your implementation will be pummeled by randomized
data structures and property-based tests to see if you overlooked
anything.

Send a pull request with your completed and passing implementation
and we can all learn from your techniques.

### How to submit an answer

1. Pick an algorithm or data structure that interests you such as
binary search trees.
1. Copy the submission template in `submissions/bst` and name it
`submissions/bst/[your-github-name].js`
1. Fill in the empty functions.
1. Run the tests with `node test/bst.js`

The tests will notice the file you created in the `bst` folder
and put it through the cleansing fire.
