### I ðŸ”§ Algâš™rithms

Love 'm or hate 'm, algo questions reign supreme at tech interviews.
Through practice I'll learn to love them, especially working in
Haskell to learn that better at the same time.

I chose the questions from
[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/)
popular Reddit post. Each answer contains notes to myself about
clarifying questions to ask the interviewer, a strategic breakdown
and runtime complexity analysis.
