## Prerequisites

This algorithm requires you to create a heap data structure first.
If you haven't yet, create an entry in `submissions/prio`.

## Your challenge

You've got a heap, now sort with it! Fill out these functions and
save the result to `submissions/heapsort/[your-github-name].js`.
Run the test to see if you got it right. `node test/heapsort.js`.
Once your code passes send a pull request and add your solution to
the freezer!

### Heap sort template

```js
module.exports = function () {
  var H = require('../prio/[your-github-name]#heap.js')();

  return {

    sort: function(ar) { }

  };
};
```
