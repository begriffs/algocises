## Your challenge

Fill out the function and save the result to
`submissions/quicksort/[your-github-name].js`.  Run the test to see
if you got it right. `node test/quicksort.js`.  Once your code
passes send a pull request and add your solution to the freezer!

You might start with the simple recursive version, then tackle the
in-place partition optimization. It's easier to see the design of
the algorithm that way.

### Quick sort template

```js
module.exports = function () {
  var self
  return self = {

    sort: function(ar) { }

  };
};
```
